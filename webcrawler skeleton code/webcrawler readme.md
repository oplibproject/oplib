## Introduction
This web crawler uses Scrapy for web scraping, TensorFlow for machine learning, Elasticsearch for data storage, Prometheus for real-time monitoring, Kafka for real-time data streaming, and Redis for job queuing.

## Features
- Modular and maintainable code structure
- Real-time monitoring using Prometheus
- Robust logging
- Job queuing and caching using Redis
- Real-time data streaming using Kafka
- Text analytics using a TensorFlow model

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Scrapy
- TensorFlow
- Elasticsearch
- Prometheus
- Kafka
- H2O
- Redis
- sklearn

## Installation
To install the required packages, use the following command:
\`\`\`bash
pip install scrapy tensorflow elasticsearch prometheus_client kafka-python h2o redis scikit-learn
\`\`\`

## Configuration
1. Elasticsearch should be running on `localhost:9200`.
2. Redis should be running on `localhost:6379`.
3. Kafka should be running with a topic named `my_topic`.
4. H2O server should be running on `localhost:54321`.

## Code Snippet
Here's a shortened version of the web crawler. For the full code, see the [web_crawler.py](web_crawler.py) file in the repository.

## Running the Crawler
To run the crawler, use the following command:
\`\`\`bash
scrapy runspider my_spider.py
\`\`\`

## Monitoring and Logging
- Prometheus metrics can be accessed at `http://localhost:8000/metrics`.
- Logs are stored in `crawler.log`, which is configured to rotate upon reaching a size of 1MB.
