### Architecture & In-depth Explanation

The architecture of the search engine is designed to provide a scalable, efficient, and reliable search service. Here's how the components interact:

AWS EC2 Instances

Role: To host the web crawlers, Kafka, and Elasticsearch instances.
Internal Working: Multiple EC2 instances can be grouped into clusters for scalability. Load balancers distribute incoming data and queries among them.

AWS EC2 Documentation https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EC2_GetStarted.html

AWS Lambda

Role: Handles user queries and sends them to Elasticsearch.
Internal Working: Triggered by an API Gateway, it parses user queries, possibly expands or refines them using AI algorithms, and passes them to Elasticsearch.

AWS Lambda Guide https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/getting-started.html

-----------

Scrapy Web Crawlers

Role: To scrape web data.
Internal Working: Crawlers hosted on EC2 instances visit a predefined list of websites and extract relevant information, sending this data to Kafka for real-time processing.

Scrapy Installation https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/intro/install.html

----------

Apache Kafka

Role: Real-time data ingestion.
Internal Working: As data is fetched by crawlers, Kafka queues it for consumption by Elasticsearch. It acts as a reliable, fault-tolerant buffer.

Kafka Quick Start Guide https://kafka.apache.org/quickstart

-----------

Elasticsearch

Role: Data indexing and retrieval.

Internal Working: Stores the data received from Kafka. When a query is received from Lambda, it executes the search and returns the results.

Elasticsearch Configuration Guide https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/settings.html

-----------

AI Tools (GloVe & BERT)

Role: Enhance query processing and search ranking.

Internal Working: GloVe models are used to understand the semantic meaning behind queries, and BERT models understand the context. These models are integrated into Lambda and Elasticsearch.

## Detailed Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Initialize AWS EC2 Instances


1. Sign in to your AWS Console.
2. Navigate to the EC2 dashboard and create a new EC2 instance.
3. Install necessary software such as Docker, Git, etc.
    - [AWS EC2 Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EC2_GetStarted.html)

### Step 2: Deploy Web Crawlers using Scrapy

Role: Scrape web data.

1. Clone Scrapy repository from GitHub.
2. Customize your crawlers based on the sites you want to scrape.
3. Deploy crawlers on AWS EC2 instances.
    - [Scrapy Installation](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/intro/install.html)

### Step 3: Data Ingestion Setup using Apache Kafka

1. Install Apache Kafka on another AWS EC2 instance.
2. Configure brokers and start producing messages from your web crawlers.
3. Use Kafka consumers to read these messages.
    - [Kafka Quick Start Guide](https://kafka.apache.org/quickstart)

### Step 4: AWS Lambda for Query Processing

1. Create a new Lambda function in the AWS Console.
2. Write code to accept search queries and connect it to Elasticsearch.
3. Test the Lambda function.
    - [AWS Lambda Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/getting-started.html)

### Step 5: Elasticsearch for Data Indexing

Role: Data indexing and retrieval.

1. Install Elasticsearch on an AWS EC2 instance.
2. Index the crawled data.
3. Test search queries.
    - [Elasticsearch Configuration Guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/settings.html)

### Step 6: AI-Enhanced Query Processing

1. Download pretrained GloVe and BERT models.
2. Integrate GloVe for semantic query expansion.
3. Utilize BERT for contextual query understanding.
    - [GloVe GitHub](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/GloVe)
    - [BERT GitHub](https://github.com/google-research/bert)

### Step 7: AI-Enhanced Ranking

Role: Enhance query processing and search ranking.

Operation: GloVe and BERT refine query understanding while LightGBM assists with ranking search results.

LightGBM GitHub

1. Adapt the BERT model for search ranking.
2. Integrate this model into the Elasticsearch ranking algorithm.
