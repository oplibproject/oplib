## Overview

This project aims to create an advanced monitoring and analytics system, integrating Elasticsearch, H2O.ai, and Prometheus. It's designed to be comprehensive, robust, and production-ready.

---

## Architecture

The architecture consists of various components, each designed for a specific purpose:

- **Elasticsearch Monitor**: Monitors the health of an Elasticsearch cluster.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Uses H2O.ai for anomaly detection in the system.
- **Metrics Service**: Collects metrics from various services and updates Prometheus Gauges.
  
These components are implemented in a modular way to enable easy scalability and future development.
