## Overview

This project is an advanced search engine built using Flask for the backend and HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the frontend. It integrates various AI tools alongside traditional search capabilities to enhance the user's experience.

## Features

### Backend

1. **Elasticsearch Integration**: Utilizes Elasticsearch for powerful and efficient searching.
2. **Rate Limiting**: Uses Flask-Limiter to limit requests and protect the application.
3. **Caching**: Implements Redis to cache search results.
4. **JWT Authentication**: Secures tool registration endpoint using JWT.
5. **AI Tool Integration**: Allows registration and use of AI tools like summarization, translation, etc.
6. **Multithreading**: Uses `ThreadPoolExecutor` for concurrent processing.

### Frontend

1. **Search UI**: Provides a clean and simple interface for searching.
2. **AI Tool Buttons**: Displays buttons next to search results to activate AI tools.
3. **Viewer Window**: Opens a viewer window next to each search result to display the output of AI tools.
4. **Interactive**: Highly interactive and user-friendly.

## Installation

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- Elasticsearch
- Redis
- npm or yarn (for frontend dependencies)

### Setup

#### Backend

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py

Frontend
Navigate to the frontend folder and run:

bash
npm install
npm start

##### Running the Application

Run Elasticsearch and Redis locally or change configuration to point to your instances.
Start the backend by running app.py.
Start the frontend application.
Navigate to http://localhost:<FRONTEND_PORT> to access the application.
Future Improvements
Add more AI tools and their corresponding implementations.
Implement a more secure way of registering AI tools.
Enhance caching mechanisms.
Enhance rate-limiting strategy.
