Query Architecture
Overview
This project features an advanced query architecture designed for high-throughput, scalable data processing and machine learning feature extraction. It makes use of Flask, Elasticsearch, Kafka, and various machine learning libraries to fetch, index, and process web page data asynchronously.

Features
Modular Design: Components are separated into different classes and modules for better maintainability.
Asynchronous Web Scraping: Uses aiohttp for asynchronous I/O.
Machine Learning Feature Extraction: Integrated with FastText, spaCy, TfidfVectorizer, and XGBoost for feature extraction.
Elasticsearch Integration: Utilizes Elasticsearch for data indexing and retrieval.
Kafka Integration: Kafka is used for data pipelines.
Rate Limiting: Rate limiting to control the frequency of API requests.
Logging: Extensive logging for debugging and audit trails.
Health Check Endpoint: A /health endpoint to monitor the application's health.
Environment Configurations: Settings can be easily managed through a .env file.
Prerequisites
Python 3.8+
Elasticsearch running on localhost:9200
Kafka running on localhost:9092
Installation
Clone this repository.

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/advanced-query-architecture.git
Navigate to the project folder and install dependencies.

bash
Copy code
cd advanced-query-architecture
pip install -r requirements.txt
Create a .env file based on the .env.sample to manage your environment variables.

Load your machine learning models and place them in the project directory, if required.

Running the Application
Run app_advanced.py to start the application.

Copy code
python app_advanced.py
This will start Flask on 0.0.0.0:5000 and the processing threads.

Health Check
Visit http://localhost:5000/health to see the application status.
