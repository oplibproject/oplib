# Advanced Search Ranking Algorithm

## Overview

This repository contains a Python script that performs search result ranking using various techniques such as RandomForest, Elasticsearch, BERT embeddings, and Named Entity Recognition (NER) from spaCy. The code is designed to be highly modular, easily scalable, and production-ready.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.8+
- Elasticsearch
- Redis
- spaCy
- transformers
- scikit-learn
- Celery
- pydantic
- numpy

### Installation

To install these Python packages, you can use pip:

\```bash
pip install elasticsearch redis spacy transformers scikit-learn celery pydantic numpy
\```

## Configuration

### Elasticsearch

Make sure you have Elasticsearch running locally. If not, you can pull and run an Elasticsearch docker image:

\```bash
docker pull docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:7.9.3
docker run --name elasticsearch -d -p 9200:9200 -e "discovery.type=single-node" docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:7.9.3
\```

### Redis

Similarly, make sure Redis is running:

\```bash
docker pull redis
docker run --name redis -d -p 6379:6379 redis
\```

### spaCy

After installing spaCy, you need to download the English language model:

\```bash
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
\```

### Transformers

The Transformers library is used for BERT embeddings and is installed via pip.

## Running the Code

Simply execute the Python script:

\```bash
python ranking_algorithm.py
\```

## Features

- Elasticsearch for initial document retrieval
- RandomForest for result re-ranking
- BERT embeddings for contextual understanding
- spaCy NER for identifying specific entities like names and organizations
- Celery for async tasks
- Redis for rate limiting
