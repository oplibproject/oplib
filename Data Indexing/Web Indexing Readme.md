# Advanced Web Indexing and Feature Extraction

## Overview

This repository contains a Python application designed for advanced web indexing and feature extraction. The code leverages various technologies including Elasticsearch, Kafka, fastText, spaCy, XGBoost, and TF-IDF among others to achieve robust, production-ready capabilities.

## Technologies Used

- Elasticsearch: For storing and querying data.
- Kafka: For real-time data streaming.
- fastText: For text classification.
- spaCy: For NLP tasks.
- XGBoost: For gradient-boosted decision trees.
- Word2Vec: For word embeddings.
- TF-IDF: For feature extraction.

## Features

- Web scraping with efficient asynchronous operations.
- Feature extraction using multiple machine learning and NLP tools.
- Signal handling for graceful shutdown.
- Real-time data streaming with Kafka.
- Logging system for monitoring.

## Installation

Before running the code, make sure you have the following installed:

- Elasticsearch
- Kafka
- fastText model file
- spaCy language model
- Word2Vec model file

For Python dependencies, run:

```bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
How to Run
Start Elasticsearch and Kafka.
Load any pre-trained models.
Run the code:
bash
Copy code
python advanced_indexing.py
Signal Handling
The code is configured to handle SIGTERM and SIGINT signals for graceful shutdown. Upon receiving these signals, it will close all connections and terminate the application.
