Overview
This project is an AI-enhanced search engine backend built with Python, Flask, Elasticsearch, and Redis. It allows users to search for articles, academic papers, and more while also leveraging AI tools like summarization, translation, sentiment analysis, etc., directly within the search results.

Getting Started
Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory. Install the required Python packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install Flask Flask-Limiter Flask-CORS Flask-JWT-Extended elasticsearch redis
To start the server, run:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
AI Tools
The backend is designed to integrate various AI tools, enhancing the user experience. The following tools have been discussed:

In-Search Summarization: Allows users to summarize articles directly in the search results.
In-Search Translation: Translate articles into the user's preferred language without leaving the search page.
Real-Time Collaboration: Enables users to collaborate on documents in real-time.
Code Snippet Sharing: Share code snippets via GitHub Gist.
Sentiment Analysis: Provides sentiment scores for articles.
Personalized Content Recommendations: Recommends articles based on user history.
Natural Language Queries: Accepts search queries in natural language.
Live Customer Service: Offers real-time assistance via chatbots.
Content Categorization: Automatically categorizes search results.
Usage
Perform a GET request to /search with the query string parameter query to initiate a search. Optionally, include the tools parameter to specify which AI tools should be applied to the search results:

http
Copy code
GET /search?query=your_query&tools=summarize,translate
To add a new AI tool, POST a serialized function to /register_tool with a JWT token:

http
Copy code
POST /register_tool
Improvements
Better caching strategies.
Implementation of rate limiting for API requests.
Security measures for safely evaluating and running tool code.
AI tool implementation details.
Load balancing and fault tolerance for a more robust architecture.
